                Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs.The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

                Several tests like chest X-Ray, blood tests such as complete blood count(CBC) is performed on the patient. With the increase in computational power and development of technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks, it is possible to help doctors and patients speed up the treatment process using Artificial Intelligence.
